                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    State officials insisted that the water was safe to drink after the pipelines were switched. Even though officials received many complaints and reports about water quality, they continued to turn a blind eye towards the situation and assured the public that the water was safe to drink. It wasn’t until January 6th, 2016 Governor Snyder declared a state of emergency and the Department of Justice launched an investigation into the crisis a year after residents were exposed to the dirty water.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) failed their oversight responsibilities in all levels of government--local, state, and federal. The EPA did not carry out their duties under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Michigan state environmental agency was responsible for a delayed crisis response that allowed Flint residents to become more exposed to lead, and the city at a lower level didn’t abide by preventative rules for lead exposure.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    An independent task conducted an investigation and found criminal negligence at many levels of the government in producing unauthentic water quality reports. This ultimately caused more Flint residents to get exposed to lead contaminated water for a longer time. Ultimately, after 12 months of grand jury, 9 people were indicted on criminal charges related to actions or a lack thereof that contributed to the historic injustice of the Flint water crisis.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    The city of Flint was already distressed before the Flint water crisis was initiated, thus exacerbating the previous problems the city was facing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided response and recovery assistance for the crisis by connecting community members to helpful resources, facilitating blood lead screening procedures, and evaluating children lead exposure and its consequences. More importantly, the CDC’s response to the crisis highlighted the need for increased risk communication among government members and agencies, the lack of quality public infrastructure, and lack of primary prevention efforts.

                  <h3 class="tm-text-secondary tm-mb-5">State</h3>
                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    Michigan's Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, or Public Act 436, contributed to the beginning of the crisis. The law puts a state-appointed official in control of cities deemed by the state to be in financial distress. Flint was experiencing financial distress decades before the water pipelines were switched. The city came under emergency management in 2012 through the provisions of PA 436, ensuring that state-appointed officials forced decisions about the city’s water supply and treatment protocols with the sole intent of cutting costs. The decision to switch water pipelines without doing due diligence was the fault of the state.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    One policy failure was implicated in the federal Safe Drinking Water Act Lead and Copper Rule. It sets forth water quality standards and testing protocols. The state environmental quality department failed to require cities to treat water for corrosion in compliance with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act standards. While federal standards for lead stand at 15 parts per billion (ppb), lead levels in Flint homes were monstrously higher, at 1,000 ppb. No enforcement actions were taken to hold the state accountable or investigate deeper into the issue.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    It wasn’t until January 6th, 2016 Governor Snyder declared a state of emergency and the Department of Justice launched an investigation into the crisis an entire year after residents were exposed to the dirty water. When people initially began to complain about discolored and foul-smelling tap water and the skin rashes they received from bathing in it, state officials dismissed the issue and responded that the water was safe. Emails released from the governor’s office revealed that these complaints were ignored or put off. One of Snyder’s top aides admitted that some were attempting to turn the issue into a “political football” for their own private interests.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    Miguel del Toral, an EPA scientist, observed that the state had no corrosion-control efforts in place and claimed that lead tests were designed to show skewed results to diminish the severity of the issue. Specifically, residents were instructed to flush out water for 5 minutes before a sample of the water was taken.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    Other members of the community went public with incriminating data--a woman and her colleagues released their findings of lead tests done on 1,750 children concluding that percentage of kids with lead poisoning doubled or tripled in some neighborhoods after the crisis unfolded. Immediately, state officials were doubtful of her findings and accused her for causing hysteria among Flint. The state government failed to hold themselves accountable and take responsibility for the health of its constituents.
                  </p>

                    An independent task conducted an investigation and found criminal negligence at many levels of the government in producing unauthentic water quality reports. Ultimately, after 12 months of grand jury, 9 people were indicted on criminal charges related to actions or a lack thereof that contributed to the historic injustice of the Flint water crisis. Governor Snyder was charged with 2 misdemeanor counts of willful neglect of duty, of which he pleaded not guilty to.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    There has been minor progress in policy improvements since the heart of the crisis unfolded. Michigan made lead standards stricter at 12 ppb in 2018.

                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    One of the biggest issues was that the agency failed to collaborate with the state governments to uphold water quality standards. The EPA chose to persuade the state to act upon the issue rather than taking action themselves due to “interagency rules”, even though they had been made aware of the corrosion problem 2 seasons prior. Flint serves as an example that the agency needs to improve under what means and conditions they interact and communicate with communities impacted by dangerous environmental events.

                    The EPA is supposedly engaging in discourse with states to improve compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act and is working to revise the Lead and Copper Rule that sets standards for acceptable lead amounts found in drinking water. They are also providing additional training for EPA staff and more clearly defining when the EPA should intervene in state issues in order to prevent a disaster like Flint’s from reoccurring and ensuring an appropriate response before it’s too late.
