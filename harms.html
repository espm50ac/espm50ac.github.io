                    The housing market was severely impacted after the crisis unfolded. Home prices decreased, attributed to the costs and undesirability to have to live with unsafe water and also a diminished trust in the local government to handle crises and act in the best interest of the people for years to come.  Median home prices in Flint, Michigan were steadily increasing from a low to a high in 2014 of $46,700. After the water poisoning however, selling prices fell to $30,700.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    Moreover, small businesses, especially restaurants, lost risk averse customers as they were hesitant to eat at restaurants that potentially sourced, cooked with, and served contaminated water. Studies estimate that 500 jobs were lost as a byproduct of the distrust that led to less sales and economic activity.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    The cost of repairing the water system now lies at approximately $1.5 billion dollars, and governments are faced with the difficult task of financing and rebuilding the water infrastructure.

                    <b>Physical:</b> Crucially, 51% of households reported that the Flint water crisis worsened the physical health of at least 1 member. Throughout the crisis, over a dozen people died from Legionnaires’ disease, a type of pneumonia (lung infection), caused by Legionella pneumophila, a bacterium that grows in water and was found in the water supply.

                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    <b>Mental:</b> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) to evaluate the behavioral health of Flint residents. They found that 66% of households reported at least one adult experiencing at least one behavioral health issue more than usual, and 54% of households reporting at least one child experiencing the same. The community saw an increase in self-reported anxiety and depression rates.

                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    The water crisis was a series of government failures that not only resulted in lead in water systems but also halted adequate emergency responses and treatments. Researchers tested whether a decline in trust resulted in residents leaving the city. They concluded that there was indeed a resulting lack of trust and the consequence is the future possibility of hindrances in planning and recovery efforts, people leaving, and the inability for policy makers to restore that trust.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    The lack of government trust is a harm on citizens nationwide as well as it complicates the efficacy of crisis prevention programs moving forward.

                  Media coverage of the Flint water crisis was harmful in several ways. National news outlets started covering the crisis over a year after it had begun. The question arises whether preventative measures could’ve been taken sooner had there been adequate coverage of the crisis on a national scale, sooner. More importantly, the coverage itself was problematic. Officials’ comments about the safety of the water or handling of the crisis was preferred over the narratives of local African American activists, considering the city is 57% Black. Residents were depicted as hopeless and idle despite them lobbying and demanding reform for months prior.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                  Minorities comprised 17% of the media workforce, leading to misrepresentation in news coverage. According to a Harvard paper, this resulted in the portrayal of White people as good-hearted and rather trustworthy, and POC’s as criminal or uncredible. This contributed to a lack of context in reporting on the topic of the water crisis.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                  The media responding to the crisis in a discriminatory manner by choosing to trust officials without a reasonable cause and the structural composition of the news workforce ensured the absence of environmental security for the residents of Flint, especially those of marginalized groups.
