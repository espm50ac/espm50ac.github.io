                    Summary
                  </h3>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    There was a lack in testing and treatment of the water in the greater 
                    Flint area which caused huge health and water issues, and impacted the 
                    health of most residents. The waterway consisted of raw sewage from 
                    the city’s waste treatment plant, which also contributed to the high
                     lead levels in their drinking water.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    A major issue of the Flint Water was the concerning amount of lead and 
                    copper within the community drinking water. This caused major health issues 
                    for all demographics within the community, especially those of a younger age. 
                    Due to being introduced to concerning levels of contaminated water at such a 
                    young age, most of these kids will have health issues for a majority of their 
                    lifetime. Overall, switching the root of the drinking water to the Flint River 
                    in order to save money has caused the community to gain lifelong health issues.

                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    The calculated amount of children who exceeded the CDC’s guidelines in regards 
                    to toxicated drinking water affected expected lifetime earnings and general behavior. 
                    Logistic regression and least squares models were used to model and collect the 
                    exposure to lead levels in the neighborhood's soil as well as the hazardous contaminants 
                    being fed into the water system, all factors of the risen blood lead levels in the children.

                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    <br><br>There were many warnings and concerns that were voiced in regards to the use of the 
                    Flint River as a main source of drinking water for the greater population of the community. 
                    In fact, many officials such as Mike Glasnow, who is a laboratory and water quality supervisor 
                    for the Flint water plant, stated that he did not ever give the “OK” of sending the water out anytime 
                    soon for community drinking water as nowhere than enough testing has been done to ensure the safety 
                    and drinkability of the water. He also noted that if the water were to be distributed early, as it was,
                    that it would be directly against his will and direction. Within a few weeks of this new switch in 
                    drinking water, residents claimed that there was an odd taste, color, and odor to the water which 
                    caused them to have some very strange and poor side effects. After all of these complaints, the city 
                    of Flint was finally required to by the SDWA Lead and Copper Rule to conduct extensive sampling for 
                    lead and copper, in which the city revealed the lived in the 90th percentile, in which the lead and 
                    copper level in the water was 3 three times higher than the previous 15 years.

                  <h3 class="tm-text-secondary tm-mb-5">Effects</h3>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    An estimated 140,000 individuals were exposed to lead and other deadly and toxic contaminants due to the 
                    community wide drinking water from the Flint River. Most children exposed to the water from the Flint River 
                    obtained lead poisoning and childhood exposure to lead and copper can lead to major damage in the brain and 
                    nervous system. This can cause apparent learning and behavioral problems as well as speech and hearing 
                    problems, overall contributing to a slowed growth and development. It is even studied that there is no safe 
                    level of lead exposure in children as any level of lead exposure on children can lead to current and future 
                    health issues.

                  <p><br></p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    Even adults who have been exposed to the highly contaminated water produced from the Flint River have seen 
                    brutal effects. Adults that have been exposed to the lead can greatly increase risk for kidney disease, heart 
                    disease and high blood pressure. It also in some cases has reduced fertility as well. The high levels of contaminants 
                    and bacteria in the drinking water has killed dozens of people and left children ill. In fact, it has gotten to 
                    such a point where there has been a city-declared state of emergency until this situation is taken care of. If more 
                    testing had been conducted before the release of the Flint River for community use, most of this situation would have 
                    been prevented.
