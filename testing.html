                    Summary
                  </h3>
                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    There was a lack of testing and treatment of the water in the greater Flint area 
                    which caused huge health and water issues, and impacted the health of most residents 
                    of all ages. The waterway consisted of raw sewage from the city’s waste treatment plant, 
                    which also contributed to the high lead and general contaminant levels in the drinking 
                    water. This water was by no means safe for drinking, but was still given to the community 
                    without any forms of accurate and deep testing. This was extremely irresponsible of the 
                    government officials of Flint as it was shown that they are willing to distribute contaminated 
                    and untested water to their residents.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    A major issue of the Flint Water was the concerning amount of lead and copper within the 
                    community drinking water. This caused major health issues for all demographics within the 
                    community, especially those of a younger age. Due to being introduced to concerning levels 
                    of contaminated water at such a young age, most of these kids will have health issues for a 
                    majority of their lifetime. This sets back children academically and will link them with 
                    various learning disabilities and physical illnesses, affecting them in future aspirations 
                    as well. Overall, switching the root of the drinking water to the Flint River in order to 
                    save money has caused the community to gain lifelong health and trust issues that most if 
                    not all of the members of the community had no say over.

                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    The calculated amount of children who exceeded the CDC’s guidelines in regards to toxicated 
                    drinking water affected expected lifetime earnings and general behavior. Logistic regression 
                    and least squares models were used to model and collect the exposure to lead levels in the 
                    neighborhood's soil as well as the hazardous contaminants being fed into the water system, 
                    all factors of the risen blood lead levels in the children. The data conducted that children 
                    and pregnant women were at most risk from drinking the contaminated water, as lead levels were 
                    more predominant in those areas of people. On top of that, most individuals who fell into this 
                    category reside below the poverty level in residential areas and simply do not have access to 
                    clean and safe drinking water. So, they fully relied on the water filtered and distributed from 
                    the Flint river. While saving money can be seen as important in regards to balancing a city's 
                    finances, there was a reason switching from the Detroit water system to the Flint river water was 
                    noticeably cheaper. When people's health are on the line, an intense line of testing should have 
                    been conducted and supervised before releasing this drinking water to the public.

                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    <br><br>There were many warnings and concerns that were voiced in regards to the use of the Flint 
                    River as a main source of drinking water for the greater population of the community. In fact, many 
                    officials such as Mike Glasnow, who is a laboratory and water quality supervisor for the Flint water 
                    plant, stated that he did not ever give the “OK” of sending the water out anytime soon for community 
                    drinking water as nowhere than enough testing has been done to ensure the safety and drinkability of 
                    the water. He also noted that if the water were to be distributed early, as it was, that it would be 
                    directly against his will and direction. Within a few weeks of this new switch in drinking water, 
                    residents claimed that there was an odd taste, color, and odor to the water which caused them to 
                    have some very strange and poor side effects. After all of these complaints, the city of Flint was 
                    finally required to by the SDWA Lead and Copper Rule to conduct extensive sampling for lead and 
                    copper, in which the city revealed the lived in the 90th percentile, in which the lead and copper 
                    level in the water was 3 three times higher than the previous 15 years. However, it was too late as 
                    a good amount of the community had already been negatively impacted by the toxic drinking water the 
                    city of Flint passed out for distribution.

                <div class="text-content">
                  <h3 class="tm-text-secondary tm-mb-5">Effects</h3>
                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    An estimated 140,000 individuals were exposed to lead and other deadly and toxic contaminants due 
                    to the community wide drinking water from the Flint River. Most children exposed to the water from 
                    the Flint River obtained lead poisoning and childhood exposure to lead and copper can lead to major 
                    damage in the brain and nervous system. This can cause apparent learning and behavioral problems as 
                    well as speech and hearing problems, overall contributing to a slowed growth and development. This 
                    obviously puts these children at an extreme disadvantage to other children in other parts of the 
                    country, since other children are most likely not obtaining the learning and behavioral problems 
                    these Flint residents are obtaining as well as that they most likely are not living in poverty as 
                    well. Unfortunately, most of the children sampled and exposed to these deadly contaminants were 
                    toddlers and of the age of 2-5. It is even studied that there is no safe level of lead exposure in 
                    children as any level of lead exposure on children can lead to current and future health issues. In 
                    fact, the levels of lead in the Flint river and exposed to these children will most likely have 
                    fatal effects on these innocent kids and will unfortunately affect them for a majority of their 
                    lives. These children were seen to have lower test scores than other children in different areas 
                    who were not exposed to contaminated water.

                  <p class="tm-mb-3">
                    Even adults who have been exposed to the highly contaminated water produced from the Flint River 
                    have seen brutal effects. Adults that have been exposed to the lead can greatly increase risk for 
                    kidney disease, heart disease and high blood pressure. It also in some cases has reduced fertility 
                    as well. Furthermore, adults exposed to the Flint river water experienced hair loss, skin rashes. 
                    These were directly correlated to the heavy metals in the drinking water. Rather than physical, a 
                    good amount of adults also reported signs of depression and anxiety, as well as PTSD symptoms 
                    directly correlated to the Flint Water Crisis. These adult residents exposed to the tap water also 
                    experienced increased nausea and emotional agitation, directly pointing towards heightened 
                    psychological symptoms. So, it was clearly shown that the introduction of the contaminated water 
                    affected adults both physically and mentally. In fact, according to a Cornell study, 26.3% of the 
                    Flint residents experienced and exhibited depressive or anxious symptoms and 29% of residents met 
                    the criteria for trauma from the contaminated water. The high levels of contaminants and bacteria 
                    in the drinking water has killed dozens of people and left children ill. In fact, it has gotten to 
                    such a point where there has been a city-declared state of emergency until this situation is taken 
                    care of. If more testing had been conducted before the release of the Flint River for community use, 
                    most of this situation would have been prevented. Regardless, Flint’s adult residents had increased 
                    levels of negative health symptoms during the years of the prime of the water crisis as well as the 
                    years after than what should be expected of city population size like Flint.
