                    <b><em>The Flint Water Crisis Confirms That U.S. Drinking Water Needs Improved Risk Management</em></b><br><br>

                        Rachel Baum, Jamie Bartram, and Steve Hrudey. Environmental Science & Technology 2016 50 (11), 5436-5437. DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.6b02238.<br><br>

                        &emsp;Rachel Baum and Jamie Bartam who are both alumni from The Water Institute, Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, as well as Steve Hrudey, a Professor Emeritus in Analytical and Environmental Toxicology at the University of Alberta, are all pursuing an interest in water resource management and sanitation in safe drinking water sources. They state that improving the concept of water resource management can be done by controlling and somewhat mitigating the overall water financial as well as quality based risks. 
                        <br>&emsp;They firmly believe that these apparent water system failures could have been obviated by installing a better sense of risk management into the general structure. Having specific water safety plans, which are categorized as fundamental management procedures, can allow for major improvements in the toxicity of current water situations, notably in Flint, Michigan. In fact, areas that have implemented water safety plans have seen an increase in water quality and general public health outcomes. 
                        <br>&emsp;Understanding that risk management in regards to the current state of the water system is crucial specifically for the dilemma occurring in Flint, Michigan. This article puts water safety concerns in great detail, especially in regards to the necessary steps needed to take with current water safety plans. This article is very practical especially towards understanding and recognizing that leadership through water management is necessary in order to keep a high health standard in the overall population.
                        <br>&emsp;This article accurately underlines the necessary steps needed to take in Flint as government officials have effectively disregarded the original water safety concerns, causing the population to come down with major health issues. Including the ideas portrayed in this article in our harm portion as well as a general information page will be extremely effective.

                    <b><em>Four Phases of the Flint Water Crisis</em></b><br><br>

                    Zahran, Sammy, et al. “Four Phases of the Flint Water Crisis: Evidence from Blood Lead Levels in Children.” Environmental Research, Academic Press, 6 June 2017, www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935117303717.<br><br>

                        &emsp;Sammy Zharan who is part of the Department of Economics at Colorado State University, Shawn P. McElmurry, who is a part of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Wayne State University, and Richard C. Sadler, who is a part of the Department of Family Medicine at Michigan State University, all explains the phases in which blood lead levels in children became apparent. They state the process before the switch in water supply, after the switch before boil advisories, after the switch after boil advisories, and after the switch back to the Detroit water system. 
                        <br>&emsp;Taking a somewhat analytical approach on the overall Flint Water Crisis, this article states the effect that switching to the Flint river water had disastrous effects on the blood lead levels in the whole population, but specific adolescents. They observed that the calculated amount of children who exceeded the CDC’s guidelines in regards to the toxicated drinking water affected expected lifetime earnings and general behavior, but also that blood lead levels returned back to normal onced switched back to the Detroit water system. Following an analytical and econometric approach to analyzing the poor water levels in Flint, logistic regression and least squares models were used to model and collect the exposure to lead levels in the neighborhoods soil as well as the hazardous contaminants being fed into the water system, all factors of the risen blood lead levels in the children.
                        <br>&emsp;This article states the numerical analysis behind the Flint water crisis and the awful effects it had on the youth of Flint. While Flint saved roughly $2 million annually by making the switch to the Flint water, the social damages on the children accounted for over $65 million. This clearly shows that health concerns and issues should never be left out of government and city wide considerations, especially in regards to a major necessity such as water supply.
                        <br>&emsp;Understanding the actual analytics is crucial to making nation wide decisions, specifically towards water supplies aimed at saving money. We could incorporate this information into all of our thematic subpages, as this article really hones down on the harms, government intervention, and testing of the Flint River Water, specifically towards the blood lead levels in infants.

                    <b><em>Lessons and Implications from the Flint Water Crisis</em></b><br><br>

                    Krings, A., Kornberg, D., & Lee, S. (2019). Lessons and policy implications from the Flint water crisis (CSD Policy Brief No. 19-41). St. Louis, MO: Washington University, Center for Social Development. <br><br>

                        &emsp;Amy Krings, part of the School of Social Work at Loyola University Chicago, Dana Kornberg, part of the Department of Sociology at the University of Michigan, and Shawna Lee, part of the School of Social Work at the University of Michigan, state the disastrous problems with the Flint water crisis and the policy implications that came about it. As professionals in social work and sociology, they have studied and thoroughly understood the social and policy significance that grew due to poor water management in Flint.
                        <br>&emsp;While the original Flint water plan obviously did not go to plan as most individuals soon obtained major health issues, there was a clear motive in order to save money. This made the residents of Flint to lose trust in their government and some of these public officials even got criminal charges for these inhumane acts. In fact, the government characterized the city being in a state of “fiscal emergency” which basically took other additional public spending out of consideration, which is quite ironic because the lack of resources present was basically the cause of the extreme budgetary issues and concerns. 
                        <br>&emsp;The lack of governmental common sense gave way to multiple intervention specks and policy changes needed in order to prevent other public health crises such as the Flint water disaster. These policies could be replaced with a stronger emphasis on environmental regulations and strict enforcement at all positions of government. The Flint case also gave way to various opportunities for social practitioners and scholars to advocate for a growth in low-income community resource management and decision making that would benefit the interests of the community rather than the government officials. 
                        <br>&emsp;Using this article as a reference in our government interaction thematic subpage could help validate and boost our projects overall credibility. Since this article goes over the main flaws of the government officials during this time and helps note the improvements the nation could make, using this article in our project would help increase the credibility and add to our current information.

                    <b><em>"The Flint water crisis: a coordinated public health emergency response and recovery initiative"</em></b><br><br>

                    Ruckart, Perri Zeitz, et al. "The Flint water crisis: a coordinated public health emergency response and recovery initiative." Journal of public health management and practice: JPHMP 25.Suppl 1 LEAD POISONING PREVENTION (2019): S84.<br><br>

                        &emsp;Ruckart et al. are a group of researchers with Master’s in Public Health and PhDs working at renowned academic institutions at locations such as Michigan and Georgia, and also the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They claim that the city of Flint was already distressed before the Flint water crisis was initiated by switching the city water pipeline in an effort to save money and forgoing necessary corrosion control treatment, thus exacerbating the previous problems the city was facing. The CDC provided response and recovery assistance for the crisis by connecting community members to helpful resources, facilitating blood lead screening procedures, and evaluating children lead exposure and its consequences. More importantly, the CDC’s response to the crisis highlighted the need for increased risk communication among government members and agencies, the lack of quality public infrastructure, and lack of primary prevention efforts.
                        <br>&emsp;The data presented in the research is an epidemiologic tool called the Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) that was used to gather data on community needs after the initial disaster struck. They found that over 50% of households reported that at least 1 member in each household had more behavioral health concerns than usual and at least 1 member believed their physical health declined due to the new water source. They also worked with Michigan’s Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP) to analyze lead in children’s blood samples. The data collection methodologies are overall trusted as they involve reputable institutions.
                        <br>&emsp;We will use this research paper to Flint water Crisis on an impact level, and possibly make claims that coordinated government efforts from the local and federal levels were insufficient to adequately address the needs of the crisis.

                        &emsp;Victoria Morckel is an Associate Professor of Urban Planning at the University of Michigan-Flint and Kathryn Terzano is an urbanist who lectures at Arizona State University. They discuss the change in the levels of trust in the government from residents, positing that the water crisis was a series of government failures that not only resulted in lead in water systems but also halted adequate emergency responses and treatments. 
                        <br>&emsp;Morkel and Terzano utilize regression analyses as a means to measure a change in trust over time, specifically to test whether this lack of trust has resulted in residents leaving the city. They conclude that there is indeed a lack of trust and the consequence is the future possibility of hindrances in planning and recovery efforts, people leaving, and the inability for policy makers to restore that trust.
                        <br>&emsp;We will utilize this information in one of the key thematic subpages, namely government oversight which will include examples on how the government failed to properly address the crisis. Moreover, this article introduces the concept of a lack of government trust, which is another unique harm of the crisis on not just the people of Flint, but citizens nationwide as well as it complicates the efficacy of prevention programs moving forward.

                    <b><em>"Politics and public health: the Flint drinking water crisis."</em></b><br><br>

                    Gostin, Lawrence O. "Politics and public health: the Flint drinking water crisis." Hastings Center Report 46.4 (2016): 5-6.<br><br>

                        &emsp;Lawrence Gostin is an American Law professor and Fulbright Fellow specializing in public health who claims that the Flint Water Crisis is an illustration of the public health inequalities in the United States. He furthers that even after the crisis hit and disproportionately harmed minorities complained about the water quality, government officials did not listen for a long time, exacerbating the effects of the crisis. In fact, an independent task conducted an investigation and found criminal negligence at many levels of the government in producing unauthentic water quality reports. This ultimately caused more Flint residents to get exposed to lead contaminated water for a longer time.
                        <br>&emsp;Furthermore, the author makes a sound comparison between the small amounts of time and money that was needed to maintain high quality water pipelines and the damages and harms caused as a result of forgoing those procedures. Specifically, the cost of repairing the water system now lies at approximately $1.5 billion dollars, and governments are faced with the difficult task of rebuilding water infrastructure that continues to harm historically marginalized populations across the country.
                        <br>&emsp;While most of the evidence is not statistical, the paper does a fine job of concisely stating government failures and their associated harms on the government, the agent that caused the crisis in the first place. We will find this information extremely useful in reinforcing the segment on government failures and also corroborating on the harms portion of the website, as one harm that we haven’t yet talked about is the monetary costs generated as a result of an irresponsible course of action.
